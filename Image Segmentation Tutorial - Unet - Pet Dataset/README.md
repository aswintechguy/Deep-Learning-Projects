## Project Information

This tutorial will guide you through the process of performing image segmentation using the U-Net architecture on a pet dataset. U-Net is a popular convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for semantic segmentation tasks.

The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset is a 37 category pet dataset with roughly 200 images for each class created by the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford. The images have a large variations in scale, pose and lighting. All images have an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head ROI, and pixel level trimap segmentation.
